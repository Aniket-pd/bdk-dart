# Generated bindings live here

The Dart bindings are produced by UniFFI-Dart and are **not** checked into
source control. Run `scripts/generate_bindings.sh` to regenerate
`bdk.dart` before building or testing.

This placeholder file keeps the `lib/` directory present in the
repository so that `dart` tooling can resolve the package structure.
